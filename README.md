# Coding it Forward: Machine Learning Talk

This talk on machine learning, at the request of the [Coding it Forward Fellowship Program](https://www.codingitforward.com/), is a grab bag of topics including:
- What is machine learning?
- Ensemble modeling, focusing mostly on tree-based models.
- Model drift.

### Assets:
- The slides, covering all three of the above topics, can be found here as `cif_talk_slides.pdf`.
- The Jupyter notebook containing a shell of the ensemble modeling code, but with blanks for you to walk through on your own, can be found here as `00_ensemble_modeling_STARTER.ipynb`.
- The Jupyter notebook containing ensemble modeling code can be found here as `00_ensemble_modeling_SOLUTION.ipynb`.
